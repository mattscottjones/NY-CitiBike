The further from Manhattan we go, the fewer trips were taken (to or from). Additionally, the number of trips taken correlates with the number of stations available. People living in Queens and the Bronx have fewer options available to start or end a trip, so it makes sense that they take fewer trips overall.\n","\n","  Within Manhattan, the pattern of most trips taken follows along MTA routes (particularly the subway locations). If we were to add a layer of subway entrances on this map, it would mimic the areas of highest trip density. It seems New Yorkers who use the subway are also likely to bike to/from their subway stop of choice.\n","\n","  Corresponding to the point above, most of the trips were short. We reached that conclusion in a previous visualization, but we can more clearly understand why now. Travelers don't need to ride their bike far from their homes/destination to get to the nearest subway stop. However, the longer trips are almost all on the east and west coasts of the island (by the Hudson and East River). There are no subways running at these coasts, so that makes sense.\n","\n","  Finally, along the perimeter of Central Park is a high concentration of rides. This confirms that Central Park is a popular destination, with the lower half of the park being the more accessed half of the park."],"metadata":{"id":"1nlmgx6VeXvk"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["### 5.
